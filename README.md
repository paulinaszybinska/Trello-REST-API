# Testing Trello REST API using Postman

These are API tests for Trello conducted using Postman. <br>

Trello is a web-based project management tool that allows users to organize tasks and workflows using a visual interface with boards, lists, and cards. It is designed to enhance productivity and collaboration among team members.<br>

Postman is a popular API development tool used to design, test, and debug APIs. It offers features such as API documentation, automated testing, and collaboration among team members. Postman supports multiple HTTP request methods and allows developers to send requests to a server and receive responses. <br><br>

## Test scope

The test focus is on the Boards module from the Trello API documentation. <br>
These are functional and unit tests checking the operation of the following **CRUD operations**: <br>
* POST 
  - Create a board with a valid name
  - Create a board with no name
  - Create a board with a name that consists of only a space or spaces
  - Create a board with a name that consists of special characters

* GET 
  - Get a board
  - Get all boards

* PUT 
  - Update the name of the board to the correct new name value
  - Update the board name to consist of only one space or multiple spaces
  - Update the name of the board to include no name value
  - Update the name of the board to include special characters
  
* DELETE
  - Delete a board <br><br>

Test were conducted based on a <b>test scenario</b>: ![testScenario_TrelloAPI.pdf](./testScenario_TrelloAPI.pdf)<br>
